# Pathfinding-Visualizer
# Description
This is a pathfinding visualizer for Dijkstra's, Breadth-first Search, and A-star Algorithms. This project was completed using Python and Pygame
# Usage
Included in the files is a .exe file. Download that file and run the file.

# Challenges
I had wanted to include depth-first search but because it runs recurrsivley I supposed that Python reached it maximum recursive runs for a graph of this size. 
While the Dijkstra's looks off the code is correct for the algorithm. It does find a path and Dijkstra's does not necessarily find the shortest path.
